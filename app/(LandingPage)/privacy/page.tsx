<p className="font-bold">3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO
PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION? </p>
In Short: We only process your personal information when we believe it is
necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e. legal basis) to do so under
applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you
with services to enter into or fulfil our contractual obligations, to protect
your rights, or to fulfil our legitimate business interests. <br />
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us
to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal
information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process
your personal information: <br />
Consent. We may process your information if you have given us
permission (i.e. consent) to use your personal information for a
specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Learn
more about withdrawing your consent. <br />
Performance of a Contract. We may process your personal
information when we believe it is necessary to fulfil our contractual
obligations to you, including providing our Services or at your
request prior to entering into a contract with you. <br />
Legitimate Interests. We may process your information when we
believe it is reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business
interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and
fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, we may process
your personal information for some of the purposes described in
order to: <br />
Send users information about special offers and discounts on
our products and services <br />
Develop and display personalised and relevant advertising
content for our users <br />
Analyse how our Services are used so we can improve them

as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency,
exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as
evidence in litigation in which we are involved. <br />
Vital Interests. We may process your information where we believe
it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a
third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety
of any person. <br /><br />
<p className="font-bold">4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR
PERSONAL INFORMATION? </p>
In Short: We may share information in specific situations described in this
section and/or with the following categories of third parties. <br />
Vendors, Consultants, and Other Third-Party Service Providers. We
may share your data with third-party vendors, service providers,
contractors, or agents ('third parties') who perform services for us or on
our behalf and require access to such information to do that work. We have
contracts in place with our third parties, which are designed to help
safeguard your personal information. This means that they cannot do
anything with your personal information unless we have instructed them to
do it. They will also not share your personal information with any
organisation apart from us. They also commit to protect the data they hold
on our behalf and to retain it for the period we instruct. <br />
The categories of third parties we may share personal information with are
as follows: <br />
Data Analytics Services <br />
Social Networks <br />
User Account Registration & Authentication Services <br />
Payment Processors <br />
We also may need to share your personal information in the following

connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of
company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our
business to another company. <br /> <br />
<p className="font-bold">5. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING
TECHNOLOGIES? </p>
In Short: We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect
and store your information. <br />
We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons
and pixels) to gather information when you interact with our Services. <br />
Some online tracking technologies help us maintain the security of our
Services and your account, prevent crashes, fix bugs, save your
preferences, and assist with basic site functions. <br />
We also permit third parties and service providers to use online tracking
technologies on our Services for analytics and advertising, including to help
manage and display advertisements, to tailor advertisements to your
interests, or to send abandoned shopping cart reminders (depending on
your communication preferences). The third parties and service providers
use their technology to provide advertising about products and services
tailored to your interests which may appear either on our Services or on
other websites. <br />
Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can
refuse certain cookies is set out in our Cookie Notice:
http://www.overcore.co.uk/cookies. <br /> <br />
<p className="font-bold">6. HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS? </p>
In Short: If you choose to register or log in to our Services using a social
media account, we may have access to certain information about you. <br />
Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your thirdparty
social media account details (like your Facebook or X logins). Where
you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile information about you
from your social media provider. The profile information we receive may
vary depending on the social media provider concerned, but will often
include your name, email address, friends list, and profile picture, as well
as other information you choose to make public on such a social media
platform. <br />
We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are
described in this Privacy Notice or that are otherwise made clear to you on
the relevant Services. Please note that we do not control, and are not
responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party
social media provider. We recommend that you review their privacy notice
to understand how they collect, use, and share your personal information,
and how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites and apps. <br /> <br />
<p className="font-bold">7. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION? </p>
In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfil the
purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice unless otherwise required by law. <br />
We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary
for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention
period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other
legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your
personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have
an account with us. <br />
When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your
personal information, we will either delete or anonymise such information,
or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information
has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your
personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion
is possible. <br /> <br />
<p className="font-bold">8. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE? </p>
In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of
organisational and technical security measures. <br />
We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and
organisational security measures designed to protect the security of any
personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and
efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the
Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100%
secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or
other unauthorised third parties will not be able to defeat our security and
improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we
will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of
personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You
should only access the Services within a secure environment. <br /> <br />
<p className="font-bold">9. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM
MINORS? </p>
In Short: We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children
under 18 years of age. <br />
We do not knowingly collect, solicit data from, or market to children under
18 years of age, nor do we knowingly sell such personal information. By
using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are
the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor 
dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from
users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the
account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from
our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from
children under age 18, please contact us at admin@overcore.co.uk <br /> <br />

greater access to and control over your personal information. You may
review, change, or terminate your account at any time, depending on your

NOTICE?' below. <br />

to your Member State data protection authority or UK data protection
authority. <br />
If you are located in Switzerland, you may contact the Federal Data
Protection and Information Commissioner. <br />
Withdrawing your consent: If we are relying on your consent to process
your personal information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at
any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by
using the contact details provided in the section 'HOW CAN YOU
CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?' below. <br />
However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the

the administration and use of your account, to respond to service requests,
or for other non-marketing purposes. <br />

assist with any investigations, enforce our legal terms and/or comply with
applicable legal requirements. <br />
Cookies and similar technologies: Most Web browsers are set to accept
cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your
browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove
cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of
our Services. For further information, please see our Cookie Notice:

If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may
email us at admin@overcore.co.uk. <br /><br />
<p className="font-bold">11. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES </p>
Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
applications include a Do-Not-Track ('DNT') feature or setting you can
activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your
online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform
technology standard for recognising and implementing DNT signals has
been finalised. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser
signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your
choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted
that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a
revised version of this Privacy Notice. <br /><br />
<p className="font-bold">12. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE? </p>
In Short: Yes, we will update this notice as necessary to stay compliant
with relevant laws. <br />
We may update this Privacy Notice from time to time. The updated version
will be indicated by an updated 'Revised' date at the top of this Privacy
Notice. If we make material changes to this Privacy Notice, we may notify
you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly
sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this Privacy Notice
frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your information. <br /><br />
